The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype.</td>

Based on discussion with Cancer Interoperability Group subject matter experts, there was insufficient rationale to include the following components in the data model: StainingControl, PrimaryAntibody, Allred Score (both total and component scores). We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.</td>

		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen.

But there is no time found there, either, only a temporalContext (type Concept) and duration (not a point in time). If the specimen collection time is supposed to be recorded in Performance.Attribution (a list of actions), it would be nearly impossible to create a mapping.</td>

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding reference model class was called ConditionAssertion. The CIMI name is being changed to ConditionTopic (perhaps ConditionAssertionTopic), as anticipated here. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the ConditionAssertion has properties associated with the presence of the condition, including severity, dueTo, diseasePhase, and more. In the current logical model, the properties associated with the occurrence of a condition have been placed (more appropriately) with ConditionPresenceContext.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR Condition.category and enforce the extensible binding in US Core of Condition.code) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model.

        <td>Base class for human, material, and informational things. A non-material thing might be a goal or information relevant to health care, such as an image, consent form, or report. A material thing can be seen and touched, such as a device.

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI&#039;s participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted.</td>

CIMI Differences:
1) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.
2) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related (&#039;has-member&#039;) observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.
3) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, allowable datatype for result include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to the allowable FHIR datatypes.</td>

However, there are two problems with including FindingContext.status: (1) to align with FHIR, the datatype of status has to be Concept, but in CIMI, the datatype of status is Attribution, which can&#039;t be mapped. (2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes.
