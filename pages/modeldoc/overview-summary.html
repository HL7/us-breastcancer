In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there.</div>

The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype.</div>

The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.</div>

A corresponding type does not exist in CIMI V0.0.4. Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently. This choice means that the breast cancer profiles use the native FHIR datatype, rather than having to substitute a CIMI profile everywhere the native type is used.</div>

		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced.</div>

		Specimen collection time seems to be missing in CIMI V0.0.4. Given that is not in Specimen, the next place to look is in the associated CollectionProcedure, specifically in the Performance context of the clinical statement representing that procedure. But there is no time found there, either, only a temporalContext (type Concept) and duration (not a point in time). If the specimen collection time is supposed to be recorded in Performance.Attribution (a list of actions), it would be nearly impossible to create a mapping.</div>

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding class is ConditionAssertion, but this name has been changed to ConditionTopic, as anticipated here. ConditionAssertion had properties associated with the presence of the condition, including severity, dueTo, diseasePhase, and more. In the current logical model, any properties associated with condition occurrence have been placed with ConditionPresenceContext.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR Condition.category and enforce the extensible binding in US Core of Condition.code) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings.</div>

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI&#39;s participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted.</div>

CIMI Differences:
1) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.
2) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related (&#39;has-member&#39;) observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.
3) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, allowable datatype for result include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to the allowable FHIR datatypes.</div>

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, FindingContext includes the attribute &#39;status&#39;. However, there are two problems with including FindingContext.status: (1) to align with FHIR, the datatype of status has to be Concept, but in CIMI, the datatype of status is Attribution, which can&#39;t be mapped. (2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes. For example, in GoalContext, the status might be relative to the progress toward the goal, not the same meaning as the status of a finding.</div>

Based on discussion with Cancer Interoperability Group subject matter experts, there was insufficient rationale to include the following components in the data model: StainingControl, PrimaryAntibody, Allred Score (both total and component scores). We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

We are seeking feedback if it is better to put the positive/negative status in Value or Interpretation. The current approach is that positive/negative designation is a value, even though that value is (in fact) an interpretation of evidence (NuclearPositivity and AverageStainingIntensity).</div>
