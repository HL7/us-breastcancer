CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus more properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there.</div>

The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype.

CIMI Alignment (and question for reviewers): The Topic of this statement is &#39;Neoplasm of the breast&#39;, not &#39;Assertion&#39;, with the logic that the topic of the statement is more specific than &#39;Assertion&#39;.  The result (the value) gives the particular type (histologic type) of the condition. Does this make sense?</div>

The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed.</div>

A corresponding type does not exist in CIMI V0.0.4. Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently.

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, specimen processing is represented as a &#39;SpecimenProcessingPerformed&#39; clinical statement, mapped to FHIR Procedure. However, specimen processing should actually map to Specimen.processing, part of the Specimen resource. It would be a difficult mapping exercise (beyond the scope of this IG) to express the mapping rule that any CIMI SpecimenProcessingPerformed clinical statement needs to mapped to FHIR by (1) finding the corresponding Specimen entity, and (2) mapping the content of (possibly multiple) SpecimenProcessingPerformed into the FHIR Specimen resource. To avoid this complexity, the breast cancer model expresses the cold ischemia time as an attribute of the BreastSpecimen rather than a separate procedure.</div>

The corresponding CIMI class is ungoing a name change to include the word &#39;StatementContext&#39; and remove the word &#39;Assertion&#39;. The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR clinicalStatus, severity, and criticality) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model.

CIMI Alignment:
1) In CIMI  V0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, where specimen is 0..1. The cardinality of Specimen has been changed to 0..1 to enable FHIR mapping.
2) In CIMI V0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related (&#39;has-member&#39;) observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model. CompoundClinicalStatement has not been used to represent panel-like findings, because of the complexity of mapping this class to FHIR.
3) In CIMI V0.0.4, allowable datatypes for result (aka Value) include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to only the allowable FHIR datatypes.
4) ExceptionValue has been moved to the RecordedContext, because it is only relevant when a value is supposed to be recorded, but is not.
5) The cardinality of FindingMethod has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.method is 0..1.
6) The class PhysicalEvaluationResult has been united with this class, and the body location (AnatomicalLocation) has been added to this class. This is because bodySite is part of Observation, and it cannot be profiled out of EvaluationResult and then re-included in PhysicalEvaluationResult.
7) The cardinality of AnatomicalLocation has been changed from 0..* to 0..1 to make it possible to map to FHIR, where Observation.bodySite is 0..1.
8) The attribute evaluationDate has been moved to RecordedContext, because it only applies to evaluations that have been done.
9) The attributes device and evaluationProcedure have been removed for brevity, since they are not used in the current IG.</div>

CIMI Alignment: In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingContext included a &#39;status&#39; attribute. However, there are several problems with this. (1) To align with FHIR, the datatype of status should be Concept, not Attribution. (2) In FHIR, different types of status with different shades of meaning are found in different subclasses, for example, clinicalStatus and verificationStatus in Condition, and status in Observation. (3) Status will not be uniform in meaning across all CIMI finding contexts. For example, in GoalContext, the relevant status might be the progress toward the goal, which does not have the same meaning as the status of an EvaluationResult.</div>

Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. Although the proper place to define Members this might be in EvaluationResultTopic, it cannot be defined there because the value references EvaluationResultRecorded, which is a clinical statement class.

          <div class="block">The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement.

For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the &#39;question&#39; or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.
