      <td>A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces, for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart.

Note: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, AnatomicalLocation has no parent class. This appears to have been an oversight, and the parent should have been Entity, as modeled here. This class corresponds to that CIMI reference model class, but it would be defined in a CIMI archetype, because it involves value set bindings on each of the attributes.</td>

      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-EvaluationComponent-extension.html">EvaluationComponent</a></td>
      <td>A simplified, non-separable evaluation consisting of a finding code (represented by the Concept), value (or exception value), reference range, and interpretation. The subject of the evaluation component is the same as in the parent evaluation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-EvaluationResultTopic-extension.html">EvaluationResultTopic</a></td>
      <td>The base class, independent of context for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related (&#039;has-member&#039;) observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.</td>

      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-FindingMethod-extension.html">FindingMethod</a></td>
      <td>The technique used to create the finding, for example, the specific imaging technical, lab test code, or assessment vehicle. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this attribute is called &#039;method&#039;.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-Focus-extension.html">Focus</a></td>
      <td>The specific aspect, person, or thing related to the Subject under observation, potentially a specific condition, fetus, drug regimen, environmental location, activity, body structure, or environmental factor. For use when the observation is not the Subject as a whole. An example would be an observation related to a particular tumor, or an observation about a change in a particular behavior, or an observation about a systemic condition.
		
		CIMI Version 0.0.4 does not have this attribute, nor does FHIR 3.0.1. However, an issue has been approved for adding an attribute (focalSubject) to FHIR. That change to FHIR is anticipated here.</td>

    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext-extension.html">KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext</a></td>
      <td>KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext indicates the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present, i.e., the present time.
	
	In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this class is called KnownOrSuspectedPresent, but the name is being changed to include &#039;Context&#039;. In addition, the class AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent is being collapsed into KnownOrSuspectedPresent, so the attributes of that class are included here.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-Members-extension.html">Members</a></td>
      <td>Members represent the elements of a group of a related but independent evaluations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent evaluation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself.
		
		CIMI V0.0.4 does not have this attribute.</td>

A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar.</td>

      <td></td>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-oncology-ColdIschemicTime-extension.html">ColdIschemicTime</a></td>
      <td>The time between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced.</td>

The stage timing code is prefix on the N stage. For example, for post-neoadjuvant clinical staging, the N categories are preceded by &#039;yc&#039; (e.g. ycNX)</td>

The range allowed for this attribute shall be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model specification for SWEC.
		
		This attribute was named &#039;type&#039; in CIMI V0.0.4. However, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element ContextCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the context, not the topic.</td>

For findings, the key represents the &#039;question&#039; or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the key contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings (which by nature lack an explicit question), the key contains a default concept signifying that an assertion is being made. In all cases, the key describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.

This definition is not fully consistent with CIMI V0.0.4 (whose definition of Quantity lacks a comparator, but includes numerical precision). Complex data types that appear frequently in FHIR have not been profiled, even if CIMI defines them differently. This choice means that the breast cancer profiles use the native FHIR datatype, rather than having to substitute a CIMI profile everywhere the native type is used.</td>
