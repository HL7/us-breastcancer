      <td>A direction indicated by an angle relative to 12 o&#039;clock.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-shr-core-CodeableConcept-extension.html">CodeableConcept</a></td>
      <td>A set of codes drawn from different coding systems, representing the same concept.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-oncology-ColdIschemicTime-extension.html">ColdIschemicTime</a></td>
      <td>The time between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-entity-CollectionSite-extension.html">CollectionSite</a></td>
      <td>The body site where specimen was collected</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-DeltaFlag-extension.html">DeltaFlag</a></td>
      <td>Indicator of significant change (delta) from the last or previous measurement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-DiagnosticService-extension.html">DiagnosticService</a></td>
      <td>A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-oncology-DistanceToNipple-extension.html">DistanceToNipple</a></td>
      <td>The body site location in relation to the nipple.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-FindingMethod-extension.html">FindingMethod</a></td>
      <td>The technique used to create the finding, for example, the specific imaging technical, lab test code, or assessment vehicle. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this attribute is called &#039;method&#039;.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-Focus-extension.html">Focus</a></td>
      <td>The specific aspect, person, or thing related to the Subject under observation, potentially a specific condition, fetus, drug regimen, environmental location, activity, body structure, or environmental factor. 
		
		Focus is used when the observation is not the Subject as a whole. An example would be an observation related to a particular tumor, or an observation about a change in a particular behavior, or an observation about a systemic condition.
		
		CIMI Version 0.0.4 does not have this attribute, nor does FHIR 3.0.1. However, a FHIR tracker issue has been approved for adding an attribute (tentatively named focalSubject) to FHIR. That change is anticipated here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-oncology-MorphologyBehavior-extension.html">MorphologyBehavior</a></td>
      <td>A description of the morphology characteristics of the cancer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-finding-Precondition-extension.html">Precondition</a></td>
      <td>A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. 
		
		Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-oncology-StageTimingPrefix-extension.html">StageTimingPrefix</a></td>
      <td>Indicates when the staging was done, in terms of treatment landmarks, either clinical (at diagnosis prior to treatment) (c), pathologic (post-surgical) (p), post-neoadjuvant clinical (yc), or post-neoadjuvant pathologic(yp). The stage timing code is prefix on the N stage. For example, for post-neoadjuvant clinical staging, the N categories are preceded by &#039;yc&#039; (e.g. ycNX)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-shr-base-StatementTopic-extension.html">StatementTopic</a></td>
      <td>Compositional and reusable grouping of attributes that make up the clinical focus of an entry. 

A topic does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc.), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="StructureDefinition-shr-base-TopicCode-extension.html">TopicCode</a></td>
      <td>The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. 
		
		For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the &#039;question&#039; or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.
		
		This attribute was named &#039;key&#039; in CIMI V0.0.4. Recently, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element TopicCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the topic, not the context.</td>
