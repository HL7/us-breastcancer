Note: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, AnatomicalLocation has no parent class. This appears to have been an oversight, and the parent should have been Entity, as modeled here. This class corresponds to that CIMI reference model class, but it would be defined in a CIMI archetype, because it involves value set bindings on each of the attributes.</td>

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class would be represented as an archetype, specifically, a ClinicalStatement whose topic is ConditionAssertion and whose context is AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The name of the CIMI archetype has not been determined as of V0.0.4;. Here, the class is called Condition because it corresponds with FHIR Condition.</td>
