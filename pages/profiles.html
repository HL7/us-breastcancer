The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype.</td>

The interpretation of positive or negative (found in the interpretation property) is based on the staining percentage, and may take into account the staining intensity. 

Based on discussion with Cancer Interoperability Group subject matter experts, there was insufficient rationale to include the following components in the data model: StainingControl, PrimaryAntibody, Allred Score (both total and component scores). We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

We are seeking feedback if it is better to put the positive/negative status in Value or Interpretation. The current approach is that positive/negative designation is a value, even though that value is (in fact) an interpretation of evidence (NuclearPositivity and AverageStainingIntensity).</td>

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource.
