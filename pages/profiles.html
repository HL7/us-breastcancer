      <td>FindingTopic or diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The following steps are required to create this class in CIMI:

1) Update the CIMI Reference Model, adding the property MorphologyBehavior to create BreastCancerConditionTopic class.
2) Create an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines the new topic BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext, and introduces constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior.

In this model, the path of least work was to subclass Condition, add the new attribute, and introduce the required constraints, all at once.

The attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included in this class because of the mapping difficulties discussed in Entry.</td>

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The core attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties to FHIR DomainResource.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class would be represented as an archetype, specifically, a ClinicalStatement whose topic is ConditionAssertion and whose context is AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The name of the CIMI archetype has not been determined as of V0.0.4;. Here, the class is called Condition because it corresponds to FHIR Condition.</td>
